Higher highs and higher lows is the trend on the Case Shiller HPI which means if anyone plans on owning a home for 10 years, the statistical probability is that it will work out in your favor.  Even people who bought at the peak in 2007 only had to wait 14 years to hit those HPI levels.  And exactly none of the factors that drove the 2008 crash (robosigning, ARMs/balloon mortgages, first-time homebuyer tax credit program, loose lending standards) are in place.  As a real estate agent I&#39;m more worried about continued home price appreciation than a housing crash.  And you would think &quot;hey why would that real estate agent worry about higher home prices&quot; but it&#39;s because I want to see a stable housing market that is driven by rational decision-making and not FOMO or panic.",
